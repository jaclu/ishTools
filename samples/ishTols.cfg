#   Should sshd be activated on this device?
#
#   If activated openssh-server will be installed, so no need to
#   list it in sw_installed above, unless you also want scp, then it is

#	to ensure the entire ssh toolset is installed.
#

# If you want to maintain your ssh host keys across deploys
# save them in a tgz file. This has a huge advantage in the sense that
# all your hosts that have connected previously will not give off warnings
# that the host keys are changed, forcing you to remove the now incorrect
# host keys on every device that had made a previous connection.
#
# Even if you not really dial in, but still want to run the sshd daemon.
# There is a huge time saver on redeploys, since otherwise new host keys
# will have to be generated, and that takes quite a while on these rather
# limited devices.
#
# Here is an example of how to update/create this tarball, just to make it
# clear, this should be run on the iSH device after you have run restore-ish once
# and endured the ssh host keys being generated.
#
# It's name should match ssh_host_keys below, but needs to use
# a full path for the tar command, even if you have defined it as relative to
# the deploy dir in this config file.
#
# It must also use the the name that you get when you run hostname, in order
# for the deploy to know for what system this file should be used.
# You should use $(hostname) somewhere in the file name, to match your hostname.
# in the ssh_host_keys param below reference the same as ${this_host}
#
#   cd /etc/ssh
#   sudo tar cvfz /iCloud/ishTools/custom/device_specific/$(hostname)-ssh_host_keys.tgz ssh_host_*
#
# Since you might not have defined this for all your devices, if it is 
# missing you will be informed, but the restore procedure will not abort.
#
# Can be given relative to deploy dir, or a full path.
#
ssh_host_keys=custom/device_specific/${this_host}-ssh_host_keys.tgz

#
#   If you want to populate /root

# Set this if you want to populate /root
# Can be given relative to deploy dir, or a full path.
#
# Here is an example of how to update/create this tarball.
# tarball name should match root_home_dir_tgz below, but needs to use
# a full path for the tar command, even if you have  defined it as relative to
# the deploy dir in this config file.

# If root_home_dir_tgz is not set, this will be ignored.
#
root_home_dir_unpacked_ptr=/root/.shell_envs_cfg/preferences

#
# This action will only be done if root_home_dir_tgz points to an existing
# tarball, if this is set the root_home_dir_unpacked_ptr check will be
# skipped, since root will be emptied and thus unpacked again on repeated runs
# If undefined or not 1 previous /root content will not be purged.

#=====================================================================
#
#   If you want to enable a non-root user set a my_uname
#   If you want to reset this users env to its original state, run:
#     userdel -r username
#   And then run restore-ish again
#
#=====================================================================

# If empty/undefined no user will be created
#my_uname="jaclu"

#
# Make sure to include the shell you want to use in sw_installed above!
# If it does not exist when this is run, restore will fail.
# If it is misisng when this task is run, it will be abort with an error.

#
# If you want to run some additional restore tasks, here you can point
