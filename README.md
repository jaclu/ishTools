# ishTools
tools I use to make life easier using iSH shell

## apk-leaves
should be fully generic, uses ash shell so should work on a fresh deploy.
Would probably run on any Alpine system, but I havent tried.

## restore-ish
Restores an iSH env to include your prefered default state, idempotent, so can be run repeatedly, for instance if you change a param, one of the tarballs it uses etc.
See the header of the file for latest changes.

## samples
This is a subset of my extra_tasks, with any more private items filtered out :)
Mostly to give you a general idea of how I use it.


## initial-apks
Every now and then I update theese, always check the date to see if it is fresh enough to be usefull for you.
This directory contains lists of all apks installed out of the box generated by apk-leaves.
This way its simple to see what is needed to get all your stuff, and what you might want to remove in your restore procedure.

### apks-ish
For the default iSH filesystem

### apks-AOK
For the AOK filesystem
