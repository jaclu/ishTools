# ishTools
tools I use to make life easier using iSH shell

## apk-leaves
should be fully generic, uses ash shell so should work on a fresh deploy.

## restore-ish
Major revwrite, now identifies AOK filesystems, and adjusts procedure not
to mess with anything AOK

## Initial apks
Every now and then I update theese, always check the date to see if it is fresh enough to be usefull for you.
This contains a list of all apks installed out of the box generated by apk-leaves.
This way its simple to see what is needed to get all your stuff, and what you might want to remove in your restore procedure.

### initial-apks-ish
For the default iSH filesystem

### initial-apks-AOK
For the AOK filesystem
